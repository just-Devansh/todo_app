# Intention:
The idea was to, build my first meaningful flutter application. 
I realise my 'meaningful' means CRUD as of now. I wanted to create an application that 
teaches me how to ```ADD```, ```DELETE``` and ```UPDATE``` data in an app. 

I am also a huge sucker for To-Do lists (mind you, just making them, not completing them!), 
So that added to its meaning for me. 
I had a ton of fun making this, and a gazillion errors (I resent AppDev).

From solving a million gradle errors to downloading the RedHat Java Development Kit because
somehow my system didn't like the Oracle Java (ik, crazy). This was quite some fun.

Below mentioned are all the things I learnt that I knew jack_shit about before this app.

# Things I learnt:
1) Learnt about the _**ListView Builder**_ that dynamically builds the List.
2) Learnt about a whole lot of widgets & properties like:

    a) **MaterialButton**

    b) **CheckBox**

    c) **TextField & TextEditingControllers**

    d) **Decorations**

3) Learnt about the ```Slidable``` widget and related dependencies. Used it for task deletion.
4) Learnt about some good coding practices in Flutter development such as _making a different
   folder for the components, making a separate folder for the pages,_ etc.
5) Finally, and arguably the most important of it all, I learnt how to use ```Hive```
   to store app data locally.

   -> Made a separate ```.dart``` file for the database.
   -> Revised OOP principles by implementing the ```DataBase Class```.
   -> Instantiated a database instance and used functions like ```.put```, ```.get```, etc.
6) It was also my first time using ```async & await``` functionalities and ```asynchronous``` programming in general.

Pardon the Yellow! I've got a way to go with all things design. 

(Watch me increase my commits by making small UI and Color changes..ðŸ§” 4D CHESS?)


_To Yellow, Thank you for all the eye strain. Being a CSK fan, I don't mind Yellow all that much!_





  
Thank you for taking out time to read this blabber that I hope was beginner-friendly, for it doesn't get more beginner than ME.
